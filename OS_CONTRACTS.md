# RestylePro OS Contracts (Non-Negotiable)

## 1. Design Canonicality
Design files are immutable. Regeneration must reference a design ID, not re-imagine it.

## 2. Side Symmetry
Left and right vehicle sides are mirrored executions. No independent generation.

## 3. Fade Registry
Fade styles are selected from a finite registry. Each maps to a locked file. No prompt-based fades.

## 4. Template Authority
Vehicle templates are versioned files. Geometry is never inferred at runtime.

## 5. Output Contract
If production files cannot be generated, the system must fail loudly.
No silent fallbacks.
