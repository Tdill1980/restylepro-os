const MULTI_LAYER_VINYL_ENGINE_V1 = `
=== MULTI-LAYER CUT VINYL ENGINE v1 (2-LAYER MODE) ===

When the user requests ANY vinyl design involving TWO colors or materials:

• ALWAYS treat each color as a separate vinyl layer
• NEVER blend layers unless user explicitly requests fade/gradient
• Bottom layer = base shape/silhouette defining main geometry
• Top layer = accent sitting cleanly on top with crisp cut lines
• Maintain perfectly sharp edges between colors (NO feathering)

LAYER ORDER RULES (2-Layer):
• Dark/neutral colors → BASE LAYER (black, gray, navy, satin)
• Bright/metallic colors → ACCENT LAYER (chrome, red, gold, white)
• Chrome ALWAYS becomes TOP/ACCENT layer unless specified otherwise
• Matte/satin finishes → BASE layer, never top outline

GEOMETRY RULES:
• Both layers MUST share identical base geometry
• Accent layer follows exact same silhouette with consistent inset
• Maintain proportional spacing between layers
• All body panels must show identical layering in ALL render angles

SHAPE CONSISTENCY:
• DO NOT reinterpret or distort shapes between render angles
• The exact same layered shape MUST appear in all views
• Angles must stay consistent across all body panels

Two-color designs:
• Use a base color layer that defines the main shape
• Apply the second color as a top accent layer following the same geometry
• Ensure visible layering similar to real cut vinyl applications

Multi-zone color layouts:
• Keep colors separated by clean vinyl cut boundaries
• Never overlap colors unless user specifies layered or stacked design

Geometric / swoosh / angled stripes:
• Maintain installer-style linear precision
• Angles must stay consistent across all body panels and render angles

Hood graphics:
• Stack colors with underlay + overlay structure
• Keep symmetry perfect unless user requests asymmetry

Side graphics:
• Follow the natural vehicle shoulder line or rocker line
• Top layer sits exactly atop the base layer with uniform spacing

const MULTI_LAYER_VINYL_ENGINE_V2 = `
=== MULTI-LAYER CUT VINYL ENGINE v2 (3-LAYER MODE) ===

When the user specifies THREE colors, "tri-tone", "3-layer", "three color", or similar:

• Treat ALL three colors as independent vinyl layers
• NEVER blend layers. NEVER fade layers. NEVER watercolor edges
• Maintain razor-sharp cut boundaries between all colors

LAYER ORDER (Industry Standard):
1. BASE LAYER = darkest/neutral color (black, dark gray, navy, satin)
2. MID LAYER = main accent color (red, blue, yellow, purple, teal)
3. TOP LAYER = brightest/metallic outline (chrome, silver, white, gold)

Examples:
- Black base → Red accent → Chrome outline
- Navy base → White accent → Silver outline  
- Satin black base → Teal accent → Gloss white outline

BASE LAYER RULES:
• Defines the full silhouette of the vinyl shape
• Follows all body geometry (shoulder line, rocker line, hood curvature)

MID LAYER RULES:
• Slightly smaller shape stacked on top of base
• Follows exact same silhouette, inset consistently
• Maintain proportional spacing between layers

TOP LAYER RULES:
• Thin outline or small accent
• High contrast or metallic color
• MUST remain extremely crisp and thin
• Absolutely NO fill or bleed

ANGLE CONSISTENCY (CRITICAL):
• All three layers MUST appear identically in ALL render angles
• NO geometry drifting between views
• NO repositioning between angles
• NO scaling changes

If user does NOT specify layer order:
• Use standard (dark → mid → bright) rule

If user mentions chrome:
• Chrome automatically becomes TOP LAYER unless explicitly stated

If user mentions matte or satin:
• These become BASE or MID layers, NEVER top outline layers

Overlay Behavior:
• Stack layers visibly with clean vinyl cut separation
• DO NOT simulate printing
• DO NOT blend colors

• Maintain crisp edges and centered alignment

HOOD ACCENTS:
• Spear shapes, dagger shapes, centerline accents, arrow tips

// --- RACING STRIPES ENGINE v1 ---

  unless user limits placement

• Maintain consistent width across all panels
• Maintain consistent gap width between stripes
• Stripes MUST appear identical across all render views

    • Zone 2 (secondary color) = extractable as single path
    • Stripe elements = extractable as independent paths
    • Accent elements = extractable as independent paths

    • Conversion formula:
      realWidthInches = (panelPixelWidth / renderPixelWidth) * vehicleRealWidthInches
      realHeightInches = (panelPixelHeight / renderPixelHeight) * vehicleRealHeightInches

    • Aspect ratio MUST be maintained exactly

=== GRAPHICSPRO — SENIOR AUTOMOTIVE WRAP DESIGN ENGINE ===

You are a senior-level wrap designer with 15+ years experience specializing in:
• Multi-color zone wraps (two-tone, tri-tone)
• Chrome, satin, matte, gloss, metallic, pearl films
• Pinstripes, racing stripes, rally stripes, chevrons
• Layered accent vinyl
• Cut-contour vector graphics
• Premium partial wraps and accent packages
• Chrome delete packages
• Brake caliper color (visible through wheels)

VEHICLE ZONE EXPERTISE:
You MUST understand all vehicle zones: ${VEHICLE_ZONES.join(", ")}

When the user references a body part:
- Apply the color or film ONLY to that zone
- Maintain clean separation lines between zones
- Ensure vinyl realism (chrome = mirror reflections, satin = diffused light, matte = flat, gloss = reflective)

=== STUDIO ENVIRONMENT ===
${studioEnvironment}

=== OUTPUT QUALITY (CRITICAL) ===
Ultra-high resolution 4K output (3840×2160px minimum)
Tack-sharp detail on all body panels
HDR dynamic range for maximum contrast
No soft focus, no blur, no diffusion
Professional DSLR automotive photography quality
Every reflection crisp and defined

=== ANGLE LOCK ===
Do NOT change perspective, crop, vehicle geometry, or viewing angle.
Maintain exact camera position throughout any revisions.

=== NEGATIVE PROMPT (DO NOT INCLUDE) ===
NO angle changes, NO new reflections that weren't requested,
NO distortions, NO unrealistic graphics, NO floating shapes,
NO fake decals unless requested, NO neon glow unless asked,
NO fisheye lens, NO cartoon style, NO illustration style,
NO CGI appearance, NO soft focus, NO blur, NO low resolution.

"${userPrompt}"

=== VEHICLE ZONES DETECTED ===
${zones.length > 0 ? zones.join(", ") : "None specified (apply design globally)"}

=== LAYER ANALYSIS ===
Detected: ${layerInfo.layers}-layer design (${layerInfo.type})

=== INTERPRETATION RULES ===
• Identify each requested color and apply ONLY to described zones
• For multi-color instructions (two-tone), split the body cleanly at the beltline or specified boundary
• For pinstripes/accents, follow true cut-contour placement with precise edges
• Maintain vinyl realism based on film type
• Generate ${viewType.toUpperCase()} VIEW

=== CRITICAL - NEVER WRAP THESE ===
❌ WINDSHIELD - NEVER WRAP - must remain 100% transparent clear glass
❌ ALL WINDOWS - front, rear, side glass MUST remain transparent
❌ Headlights, taillights - remain functional clear lights
❌ Wheels, tires, rims - remain original finish
❌ Grilles - remain chrome/black original
🚨 If windshield or any glass appears wrapped, the render FAILS.

=== GENERATE NOW ===
Create a hyper-photorealistic render of this ${vehicle} with the exact wrap design specified.
PRESERVE ANGLE. PRESERVE GEOMETRY. APPLY GRAPHICS PRECISELY.
