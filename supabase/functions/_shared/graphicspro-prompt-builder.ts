const MULTI_LAYER_VINYL_ENGINE_V1 = `
=== MULTI-LAYER CUT VINYL ENGINE v1 (2-LAYER MODE) ===

When the user requests ANY vinyl design involving TWO colors or materials:

• ALWAYS treat each color as a separate vinyl layer
• NEVER blend layers unless user explicitly requests fade/gradient
• Bottom layer = base shape/silhouette defining main geometry
• Top layer = accent sitting cleanly on top with crisp cut lines
• Maintain perfectly sharp edges between colors (NO feathering)

LAYER ORDER RULES (2-Layer):
• Dark/neutral colors → BASE LAYER (black, gray, navy, satin)
• Bright/metallic colors → ACCENT LAYER (chrome, red, gold, white)
• Chrome ALWAYS becomes TOP/ACCENT layer unless specified otherwise
• Matte/satin finishes → BASE layer, never top outline

GEOMETRY RULES:
• Both layers MUST share identical base geometry
• Accent layer follows exact same silhouette with consistent inset
• Maintain proportional spacing between layers
• All body panels must show identical layering in ALL render angles

SHAPE CONSISTENCY:
• DO NOT reinterpret or distort shapes between render angles
• The exact same layered shape MUST appear in all views
• Angles must stay consistent across all body panels

Two-color designs:
• Use a base color layer that defines the main shape
• Apply the second color as a top accent layer following the same geometry
• Ensure visible layering similar to real cut vinyl applications

Multi-zone color layouts:
• Keep colors separated by clean vinyl cut boundaries
• Never overlap colors unless user specifies layered or stacked design

Geometric / swoosh / angled stripes:
• Maintain installer-style linear precision
• Angles must stay consistent across all body panels and render angles

Hood graphics:
• Stack colors with underlay + overlay structure
• Keep symmetry perfect unless user requests asymmetry

Side graphics:
• Follow the natural vehicle shoulder line or rocker line
• Top layer sits exactly atop the base layer with uniform spacing

// --- MULTI-LAYER CUT VINYL ENGINE v2 (3-LAYER MODE) ---
const MULTI_LAYER_VINYL_ENGINE_V2 = `
=== MULTI-LAYER CUT VINYL ENGINE v2 (3-LAYER MODE) ===

When the user specifies THREE colors, "tri-tone", "3-layer", "three color", or similar:

• Treat ALL three colors as independent vinyl layers
• NEVER blend layers. NEVER fade layers. NEVER watercolor edges
• Maintain razor-sharp cut boundaries between all colors

LAYER ORDER (Industry Standard):
1. BASE LAYER = darkest/neutral color (black, dark gray, navy, satin)
2. MID LAYER = main accent color (red, blue, yellow, purple, teal)
3. TOP LAYER = brightest/metallic outline (chrome, silver, white, gold)

Examples:
- Black base → Red accent → Chrome outline
- Navy base → White accent → Silver outline  
- Satin black base → Teal accent → Gloss white outline

BASE LAYER RULES:
• Defines the full silhouette of the vinyl shape
• Follows all body geometry (shoulder line, rocker line, hood curvature)

MID LAYER RULES:
• Slightly smaller shape stacked on top of base
• Follows exact same silhouette, inset consistently
• Maintain proportional spacing between layers

TOP LAYER RULES:
• Thin outline or small accent
• High contrast or metallic color
• MUST remain extremely crisp and thin
• Absolutely NO fill or bleed

ANGLE CONSISTENCY (CRITICAL):
• All three layers MUST appear identically in ALL render angles
• NO geometry drifting between views
• NO repositioning between angles
• NO scaling changes

If user does NOT specify layer order:
• Use standard (dark → mid → bright) rule

If user mentions chrome:
• Chrome automatically becomes TOP LAYER unless explicitly stated

If user mentions matte or satin:
• These become BASE or MID layers, NEVER top outline layers

Overlay Behavior:
• Stack layers visibly with clean vinyl cut separation
• DO NOT simulate printing
• DO NOT blend colors

When a user requests ANY vinyl shape by name or description, interpret using these installer-accurate categories:

DART SHAPES:
• Long, tapering graphics pointing forward or backward
• Used on muscle cars, trucks, sport compacts
• Maintain sharp points and symmetrical thickness

SCALLOPS:
• Rounded leading edges with tapered ends
• Used in hot rod, lowrider, retro car designs
• Maintain clean curvature and layered highlights

SWOOSH / WAVE STRIPES:
• Flowing graphics that follow body lines
• Must remain smooth with consistent arc geometry

OEM HERITAGE STRIPES:
• GT stripes, ZL1-style, Roush stripes, Boss 302
• Camaro shoulder stripes, Mopar bumblebee stripes
• Use correct symmetry and period-relevant proportions

NUMBER PLATE / RACE PANEL:
• Rectangular or oval panel areas for numbers
• Placed on doors, hood, or trunk per user prompt
• Maintain crisp edges and centered alignment

HOOD ACCENTS:
• Spear shapes, dagger shapes, centerline accents, arrow tips
• Always centered unless user requests offset

SIDE ROCKER STRIPES:
• Horizontal stripes along lower door or rocker panel
• Must follow rocker geometry — never floating or crooked

WHEEL ARCH ACCENTS:
• Stripes that trace wheel arch curvature
• Must be perfectly smooth and follow arch radius

TAILGATE GRAPHICS:
• Centerline stripes or symmetrical designs on trucks
• Must not wrap onto bumper unless user requests

For ANY shape not explicitly listed, infer closest style using real-world vinyl installer knowledge.

// --- RACING STRIPES ENGINE v1 ---
const RACING_STRIPES_ENGINE_V1 = `
=== RACING STRIPES ENGINE v1 ===

When user requests "racing stripes," "center stripes," "dual stripes," "rally stripes," or any variation:

• ALWAYS use two parallel stripes unless user specifies single stripe
• Stripes must run continuously from:
    - front bumper → hood → roof → trunk → rear bumper
  unless user limits placement

• Maintain consistent width across all panels
• Maintain consistent gap width between stripes
• Stripes MUST appear identical across all render views

Single wide stripe:
• Must remain centered unless user specifies offset

Offset racing stripes:
• Must maintain fixed distance from vehicle centerline

Hood-only stripes:
• Must follow hood curvature and body lines

Color Rules:
• Base stripe color = user's primary color
• Outline stripe (if requested) = contrast color
• Top highlight (if 3-layer) = brightest color

• NO blending, NO fading (unless requested), NO distortions

"roof only":
• Apply stripes or graphics ONLY on the roof panel

"doors only":
• Apply vinyl exclusively within door panel boundaries

"bedside only" (for trucks):
• Apply to left and right bedsides, respecting wheel arch boundaries

• "left half [COLOR] right half [COLOR]"  
• "driver side [COLOR] passenger side [COLOR]"
• "driver's side [COLOR] passenger's side [COLOR]"
• "split down the middle" with two colors

VERTICAL SPLIT LINE:
• The dividing line runs DOWN THE CENTER of the vehicle (front to back)
• Split follows the vehicle's centerline: center of hood, center of roof, center of trunk/tailgate
• Creates a clean vertical division between left and right halves

LEFT SIDE (Driver Side in US):
• Entire left exterior: left half of hood, left fender, left doors, left quarter panel, left half of roof, left half of trunk
• Apply specified color/finish to ALL left-facing panels

RIGHT SIDE (Passenger Side in US):
• Entire right exterior: right half of hood, right fender, right doors, right quarter panel, right half of roof, right half of trunk
• Apply specified color/finish to ALL right-facing panels

CENTER STRIPE WITH SIDE SPLIT:
If user requests center stripe with left/right colors:
• Apply left color to left side
• Apply right color to right side
• Apply stripe color as a CENTER STRIPE running hood → roof → trunk
• Stripe sits ON TOP of the color split line

MULTI-VIEW CONSISTENCY (CRITICAL):
• Side view shows ONE color prominently (the visible side)
• Front view shows BOTH colors split at center with clean dividing line

When user requests body-line stripes, use these EXACT placement definitions:

🚨 CRITICAL STRIPE-ONLY RULE:
When user requests a STRIPE (beltline stripe, rocker stripe, racing stripe, etc.):
• The VEHICLE BODY COLOR REMAINS UNCHANGED (original color or user-specified base color)
• ONLY the STRIPE ITSELF gets the specified color(s)
• DO NOT repaint the entire vehicle
• DO NOT create multi-zone wraps unless explicitly requested
• Stripes are THIN ACCENT LINES on top of the base vehicle paint

Example: "red and gold beltline stripe on green car"
• Vehicle body = GREEN (stays green everywhere)
• Beltline stripe ONLY = red with gold accent/outline
• Result: Green car with a thin red/gold stripe along the beltline

ROCKER STRIPE:
• Placement: Horizontal stripe along LOWER BODY, 8-14 inches from ground
• Follows rocker panel contour continuously from front fender to rear quarter
• MUST NOT rise above door crease line
• Typical width: 2-6 inches
• Boundaries: Starts behind front wheel arch, ends at rear wheel arch

BELTLINE STRIPE:
• Placement: Mid-body stripe along BELT LINE CREASE (window sill height)
• Follows natural body character line at window bottom edge
• MUST follow door panel break points naturally
• Typical width: 1-4 inches
• Boundaries: Front fender behind headlight to rear quarter behind door
• THIS IS A THIN HORIZONTAL LINE, NOT A FULL BODY WRAP

SHOULDER STRIPE:
• Placement: Upper body stripe JUST BELOW window line
• Sits on the shoulder crease above doors
• MUST NOT touch window glass
• Typical width: 2-4 inches
• Boundaries: A-pillar area to C-pillar or quarter panel

QUARTER PANEL ACCENT:
• Placement: Rear quarter panel sweep from door edge to tail
• Flows along rear wheel arch and quarter panel shape
• Can wrap around to taillight area
• Typical width: 3-8 inches
• Boundaries: Rear door edge to taillight

FENDER-TO-QUARTER SWEEP (SWOOSH):
• Placement: Continuous flowing stripe from front fender to rear quarter
• Follows vehicle's upper body line in smooth arc
• MUST maintain smooth continuous curve
• Typical width: 4-10 inches
• Boundaries: Front fender behind headlight to rear quarter at taillight

MULTI-VIEW CONSISTENCY (CRITICAL):
• Stripe placement MUST be IDENTICAL in all render views
• Stripe width MUST be consistent across all panels
• Stripe color MUST match exactly in all angles
• NO drift, NO repositioning, NO scaling between views

• "front half", "rear half"
• "hood only", "roof only", "sides only", "doors only"

WHEN USER OVERRIDE DETECTED:
1. IGNORE all preset geometry definitions
2. IGNORE all OEM geometry definitions
3. APPLY user's geometric specification EXACTLY
4. Style reference modifies APPEARANCE only, NOT placement

PRIORITY ORDER:
1. USER GEOMETRY → highest priority (if override phrase detected)

STYLE REFERENCES MODIFY APPEARANCE, NOT PLACEMENT:

When user provides a style reference (lowrider, hot rod, JDM, etc.):
• Apply reference's LINE LANGUAGE (curve flow, flourishes)
• Apply reference's STROKE WEIGHT (thin, thick, tapered)
• Apply reference's ACCENT BEHAVIOR (pinstripes, outlines)
• DO NOT apply reference's geometric placement

OEM GEOMETRY STAYS ACCURATE:
• Mustang GT stripes stay in Mustang GT positions
• Camaro hockey stripes stay in Camaro positions
• Porsche door stripes stay at Porsche height
• Style reference cannot move stripes to different panels

EXAMPLE:
User: "Mustang GT stripes with lowrider styling"
• Apply Mustang GT stripe PLACEMENT (hood to trunk)
• Apply lowrider STYLE (thicker lines, chrome outline, scalloped edges)
• DO NOT move stripes to lowrider positions

This prevents style references from destroying OEM accuracy.

When user requests "lowrider stripe", "low rider stripe", "lowrider graphics", or "lowrider side stripe":
THIS IS A SPECIFIC STRIPE TYPE, NOT A STYLE MODIFIER.

LOWRIDER STRIPE CHARACTERISTICS:
• Flowing, organic curves along the vehicle sides
• Scalloped or wavy edges (not straight geometric lines)
• Often multi-layered with outline + fill
• Classic hot rod / custom car aesthetic
• Placement: typically mid-body along doors and quarters

LOWRIDER STRIPE GEOMETRY:
• Primary band: 6-12 inches wide, flowing curve from front fender to rear quarter
• Edge style: scalloped, flame-inspired, or flowing wave pattern
• Position: mid-body height (between rocker and beltline)
• May include accent pinstripe outline (1/4" chrome or contrasting color)

LAYERING (if multi-color specified):
• Base layer: main color, defines flowing shape
• Accent layer: contrasting outline following scalloped edges
• Optional chrome pinstripe: thin highlight on outer edge

REFERENCE IMAGE HANDLING:
• If user uploads a reference image, MATCH THE EXACT STYLE from the image
• Copy the curve flow, scallop pattern, and edge treatment from reference
• Adapt the reference pattern to fit the specific vehicle's proportions
• DO NOT ignore reference images - they define the exact stripe style wanted

TYPICAL COLOR COMBINATIONS:
• Gold/tan scallops with chrome outline
• Metallic flake with pinstripe accent
• Two-tone flowing curves (light over dark or dark over light)

MULTI-VIEW CONSISTENCY:
• Flowing curves MUST be identical across all render views
• Scalloped edges must maintain exact same pattern in all angles
• NO drifting or repositioning between views

A reference image has been uploaded showing the EXACT style wanted.

YOU MUST:
• STUDY the reference image carefully
• MATCH the exact curve flow, scallop pattern, edge treatment
• REPLICATE the stripe style, width, and placement from the reference
• ADAPT the design to fit the target vehicle's proportions
• MAINTAIN the same visual language (thick/thin lines, flowing curves, layered effects)

DO NOT:
• Ignore the reference image
• Create a generic design instead
• Change the style significantly from the reference

The reference image is your PRIMARY source of design direction.

=== GRAPHICSPRO — SENIOR AUTOMOTIVE WRAP DESIGN ENGINE ===

You are a senior-level wrap designer with 15+ years experience specializing in:
• Multi-color zone wraps (two-tone, tri-tone)
• Chrome, satin, matte, gloss, metallic, pearl films
• Pinstripes, racing stripes, rally stripes, chevrons
• Layered accent vinyl and cut-contour graphics
• Premium partial wraps and accent packages
• Chrome delete packages
• Brake caliper coloring (visible through wheel spokes)

=== VEHICLE ZONE KNOWLEDGE ===
You MUST understand all vehicle zones: ${VEHICLE_ZONES.join(", ")}

When the user references a body part:
- Apply the color or film ONLY to that zone
- Maintain clean separation lines between zones
- Ensure vinyl realism (chrome = mirror, satin = diffused, matte = flat)

=== LAYER ANALYSIS ===
Detected: ${layerInfo.layers}-layer design (${layerInfo.type})

=== INTERPRETATION RULES ===
• Identify each requested color and apply ONLY to described zones
• For multi-color instructions, split the body cleanly
• For pinstripes/accents, follow true cut-contour placement
• Maintain vinyl realism based on film type
• Generate ${viewType.toUpperCase()} VIEW FIRST

=== CRITICAL - NEVER WRAP THESE ===
❌ WINDSHIELD - NEVER WRAP - must remain 100% transparent clear glass
❌ ALL WINDOWS - front, rear, side glass MUST remain transparent
❌ Headlights, taillights - remain functional clear lights
❌ Wheels, tires, rims - remain original finish
❌ Grilles - remain chrome/black original
🚨 If windshield or any glass appears wrapped, the render FAILS.

=== TRUCK ZONE CALIBRATION (HIGH BELTLINE VEHICLES) ===
Trucks have elevated belt lines. For top/bottom two-tone splits:
• TOP ZONE (gold chrome) = upper 30-35% of vehicle body height
• BOTTOM ZONE (satin black) = lower 65-70% of vehicle body height
• The belt line on trucks is HIGHER than sedans
• Apply this ratio consistently across all angles and panels
• Include bedside panels in proper zone allocation
=== END TRUCK CALIBRATION ===
` : ''}

=== FINAL GEOMETRY OVERRIDE (MANDATORY - OVERRIDES ALL PRIOR RULES) ===

⚠️ IGNORE any conflicting instructions from presets, OEM patterns, style engines, or templates.

YOU MUST APPLY THIS EXACT GEOMETRY:

• If user specified "GOLD CHROME TOP HALF" or similar → Apply ONLY to top half of vehicle body
• If user specified "SATIN BLACK BOTTOM HALF" or similar → Apply ONLY to bottom half of vehicle body

DEFINITIONS:
• "Top Half" = all panels ABOVE the shoulder line (belt line):
    - upper doors
    - upper fenders  
    - upper quarters
    - upper bedside (trucks)
    - A-pillars
    - roof (if visible)

• "Bottom Half" = all panels BELOW the shoulder line:
    - lower doors
    - rocker zones
    - lower fenders
    - lower quarters
    - lower bedside

ABSOLUTE RULES:
• DO NOT allow top-half color to enter lower-body zones
• DO NOT allow bottom-half color to rise above upper-body zones
• The split MUST be perfectly horizontal — NO fade, NO diagonal, NO angle
• The split MUST be IDENTICAL across ALL render views
• DO NOT reinterpret layout in different frames
• DO NOT merge preset geometry into user's split definition

🔴 THIS IS FINAL AND OVERRIDES ALL PREVIOUS RULES 🔴

=== GENERATE NOW ===
Create hyper-photorealistic render of ${vehicle} with exact wrap design specified.
PRESERVE ANGLE. PRESERVE GEOMETRY. APPLY USER'S TOP/BOTTOM SPLIT PRECISELY.
