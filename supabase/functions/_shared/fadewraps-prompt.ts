=== FADEWRAPS™ GRADIENT TRAINING ===
FadeWraps must display HIGH CONTRAST, DRAMATIC, VIVID, UNMISTAKABLE gradients.

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Minimum 10:1 contrast ratio between start and end colors
- Start colors: BRIGHT, SATURATED, VIVID (full intensity)
- End colors: VERY DARK, near black or pure black
- Gradients must be OBVIOUS and BOLD, never subtle or washed out
- Proper color space blending to avoid muddy mid-tones
- If gradient appears subtle or washed out, increase saturation by 30%

VISUAL EXAMPLES:
- PURPLE FADEWRAP: Start with VIBRANT BRIGHT PURPLE (#8B00FF) → End in PURE DEEP BLACK (#000000)
- BLUE FADEWRAP: Start with ELECTRIC CYAN BLUE (#00BFFF) → End in PURE BLACK (#000000)
- ORANGE FADEWRAP: Start with BLAZING BRIGHT ORANGE (#FF6600) → End in PURE BLACK (#000000)
- LIME FADEWRAP: Start with NEON LIME GREEN (#CCFF00) → End in PURE BLACK (#000000)

The gradient transition should be smooth but dramatic - viewers must immediately recognize the color fade effect.
